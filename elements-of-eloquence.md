# Notes on the Rhetorical Figures of Speech

From **_The Elements of Eloquence: Secrets of the Perfect Turn of Phrase_ by Mark Forsyth**

1. **Alliteration**

    A little goes a long way.

    ```
    The barge she sat in like a burnished throne, 
    Burned on the water: the poop was beaten gold; 
    Purple the sails and so perfumed that The winds 
    were lovesick with them; the oars were silver, 
    Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke, and made 
    The water which they beat to follow faster, 
    As amorous of their strokes.
    ```

2. **Polyptoton**

    The stylistic scheme in which words derived from the same root are repeated (such as "strong" and "strength"). 

    ```
    Judge not, that ye be not judged
    ```

    ```
    The Greeks are strong, and skillful to their strength, Fierce to their skill, and to their fierceness valiant
    ```
    
    ```
    Absolute power corrupts absolutely
    ```

    ```
    Thank me no thankings, nor proud me no prouds.
    ```

3. **Antanaclasis**

    in which the same word is repeated, but each time with a different sense. 

    ```
    Please please me
    ```
    
    ```
    Time flies like an arrow; fruit flies like a banana
    ```
    
    ```
    We aim to please; You aim too, please
    ```
    
    ```
    We must, indeed, all hang together, or assuredly we shall all hang separately
    ```

4. **Antithesis**

    First you mention one thing. Then you mention the other. X is Y, and not X is not Y.

    ```
    The well-bred contradict other people; the wise contradict themselves.
    ```

    ```
    If one plays good music, people don't listen, 
    and if one plays bad music people don't talk.
    ```

    ```
    Fashion is what one wears oneself. 
    What is unfashionable is what other people wear.
    ```

    ```
    Those who can, do; those who can't, teach.
    ```

    ```
    Marriage has many pains, but celibacy has no pleasures
    ```

5. **Merism**

    Merism is when you don’t say what you’re talking about, and instead name all of its parts.

        The defendant is prohibited from communicating with the plaintiff, 
        either personally or through other persons, by telephone, writing 
        or any other means.

6. **Blazon**

    Too many merisms, all strung together. Usually makes for something super awkward.

        Full fathom five thy father lies; 
        Of his bones are coral made; 
        Those are pearls that were his eyes; 
        Nothing of him that doth fade, 
        But doth suffer a sea-change Into something rich and strange.

7. **Synaesthesia**

    Mixing the senses. Usually sight and sound used interchangeably.

        Music that stinks to the ear

8. **Aposiopesis**

    Ending with three dots because
        + you can’t go on
        + you don’t need to go on
        + you want to leave the audience hanging.

        When in Rome...

9. **Hyperbaton**

    Fucking with word order.

        Uneasy lies the head that wears the crown.

10. **Anadiplosis**

    The repetition of the last word of a preceding clause. The word is used at the end of a sentence and then used again at the beginning of the next sentence. Gives an illusion of logical progression.

    ```
    Your beliefs become your thoughts, your thoughts become your words, 
    your words become your actions, your actions become your habits, 
    your habits become your values, your values become your destiny.
    ```

    ```
    Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger. 
    Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering.
    ```

    ```
    Information is not knowledge, knowledge is not wisdom, 
    wisdom is not truth, truth is not beauty, beauty is not love, 
    love is not music and music is the best.
    ```

11. **Periodic sentence**

    A freaking long sentence that isn't syntactically complete until the end. Rudyard Kipling poem "If" is a famous example. Forces you to keep on reading to resolve the sentence. Mechanically achieved by saving the main verb for the end.

        Every breath you take,
        Every move you make,
        Every bond you break,
        Every step you take,
        I'll be watching you.

12. **Polysyndeton**

    Using lots of conjunctions.

        And Jesus took break, and blessed it, and brake it, 
        and gave it to his disciples.

13. **Parataxis**
    
    Not using any conjunctions. Simple sentences only.

14. **Hypotaxis**

    Preposterously long sentences, with lots and lots of clauses.

    > The alternative, should you, or any writer of English, choose to employ it (and who is to stop you?) is, by use of subordinate clause upon subordinate clause, which itself may be subordinated to those clauses that have gone before or after, to construct a sentence of such labyrinthine grammatical complexity that, like Theseus before you when he searched the dark Minoan mazes for that monstrous monster, half bull and half man, or rather half woman for it had been conceived from, or in, Pasiphae, herself within a Daedalian contraption of perverted intention, you must unravel a ball of grammatical yarn lest you wander forever, amazed in the maze, searching through dark eternity for a full stop.


15. **Diacope**

    A verbal sandwich in which a word is repeated after a short interruption.

    Vocative forms repeat a name or verb:

        Bond. James Bond.

        Fly, my pretties, fly!

        Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?

        Crisis? What Crisis?

    Also elaborative form adds an adjective:

        From sea to shining sea!

        O Captain! My Captain!


16. **Rhetorical questions**

    Can be used to lead an audience to the answer we want.

17. **Hendiadys**

    Transform "adjective-noun" to "nounified-adjective and noun"

    ```
    I walked through the rainy morning 
        -> I walked through the rain and the morning
    ```

18. **Epistrophe**

    Repetition at the end of sentences or paragraphs. Trope of obsession / emphasis.

19. **Tricolon**

    Three things making a list that gives a sense of completeness. Statesmenlike. Obama and Churchill love them.

        Blood, sweat, and tears.

20. **Epizeuxis**

    Repeating something for emphasis. Nuclear option for emphasis.

        Location, location, location.

        The horror! The horror!

        Words. words. words.

21. **Syllepsis**

    When one word is used in two incongruous ways.

        I've barely room enough to lay my hat and a few friends.

        She made no reply, up her mind, and a dash for the door

        Stain her honour or her new brocade

        Mr. Pickwick took his hat and his leave

        Make love not war


22. **Isocolon**

    Two clauses that are gramatically parallel.

        Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee.

        Roses are red. Violets are blue.

23. **Enallage**

    A deliberate grammatical mistake.

        Mistah Kurtz--he dead.

        We was robbed
        
        Love me tender

24. **Some notes on verse**

    The types of poetic feet
    - Iamb: te-TUM
    - Trochee: TUMty
    - Anapest: te-te-TUM
    - Dactyl: TUM-te-ty

    When there is an even number of feet rhyming is important.
    With an odd number of feet people naturally add a pause.

25. **Paradox**

26. **Chiasmus**

    Pleasing symmetry. Can be word level:

        Tea for two and two for tea
        Me for you and you for me

    Can also be symmetry of vowel sounds:

        In Xanadu did Kubla Khan

        Beneath the thunders of the upper deep

27. **Assonance**

    Repeating the same vowel sounds. Useful, but not as durable as alliteration or consonance because vowels tend to shift in language over time. Also English has a lot of schwa's that are spelled as vowels but really sound like all/none of them.

        I met a traveller in an antique land

28. **The fourteenth rule**

    Substitute specific numbers for vague quantifiers like several, some, or many. Numbers make it more memorable and mysterious.

        Fifteen men on a dead man's chest

        It is an Ancient Mariner / And he stoppeth one of three

        Nine Ring Wraiths

29. **Catachresis**

    A sentence so startlingly wrong that it's right.

        I will speak daggers to her, but use none.

        Curiouser and curiouser!

        Thunderbirds are go.

30. **Litotes**

    Confirming something by denying its opposite. Depends on audience recognizing understatement.

        I wouldn't say no.


31. **Synecdoche**

    a figure of speech in which a part is made to represent the whole or vice versa

        And what shoulder, & what art. 
        Could twist the sinews of thy heart?
        And when thy heart began to beat, 
        What dread hand? & what dread feet?

        Was this the face that launched a thousand ships 
        And burnt the topless towers of Ilium?

32. **Transferred epithets**

    Adjective applied to the wrong noun. Usually human emotions or descriptions applied to objects.

        The man smoked a nervous cigarette

        Gas! Gas! Quick, boys!--an ectasy of fumbling
        Fitting the clumsy helmets just in time...

        The ploughman homeward plods his weary way

33. **Pleonasm**

    Adding redundant descriptive words for aesthetic affect.

    ```
    I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my help.
    ```

    ```
    Dearly beloved, we are gathered together in the sight of God, 
    and in the face of this congregation, to join together this man 
    and this woman in Holy Matrimony
    ```

34. **Epanalepsis**

    Beginning and ending with the same word. Implies circularity and continuation.
        
    ```
    Yesterday
    All my troubles seemed so far away
    Now it looks as though they're here to stay
    Oh, I believe in yesterday
    ```

    ```
    The king is dead; long live the king.
    ```

    ```
    Blood hath bought blood and blows have answered blows; 
    Strength matched with strength, and power confronted power:
    ```

35. **Personification**

    Giving human traits to abstract concepts. Small glimpses work better than big elaborate descriptions. Example: Time and Death throughout Shakespeare's works.

        O, beware, my lord, of jealousy;
        It is the green-eyed monster which doth mock
        The meat it feeds on.

36. **Hyperbole**
